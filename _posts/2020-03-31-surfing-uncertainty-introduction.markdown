The "trick" of how creatures learn and interact with the world, according to
the book, is guessing what the next sensory stimulation will be and using that
prediction error as a method to drive learning.  The prediction described here
is low-level and automatic, but occurs in hierarchical units that eventually
build up to higher level concepts that pull in symbolic knowledge (e.g. I
predict the cup will feel hot because I have a higher level model of coffee and
heat conduction).  We can learn about the world by attempting to generate
incoming sensory data for ourselves.  Actions are also a part of the loop, ways
that we can bring our predictions to fruition.  As we learn more about the
world, our predictions become more accurate.

This is closely related to the Bayesian brain hypothesis; that our brain
implements some approximation of Bayesian update to weigh new evidence and
judge what the likeliest scenario is.  Thus this model contains both prediction
mechanisms and mechanisms to estimate the reliability of those predictions.
