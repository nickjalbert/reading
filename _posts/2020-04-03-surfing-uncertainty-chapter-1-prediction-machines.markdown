Basically a high-level overview of the main contrast between the traditional
cognitive science depiction of perception vs his theory.

* Traditional: perception is a cumulative bottom-up process. you detect color
  and frequency, then edges, then curves, then combine that with stored
  knowledge and you perceive a coffee cup.

* Predictive Processing: perception is prediction.  Incoming sensory data is
  meshed with prediction, error signals propagate.  When the flow of prediction
  adequately accounts for the incoming sensory signals, the coffee cup is
  perceived.

Other notables from the chapter:

* He discusses the difficult task facing the brain; it sits in a dark box and
  all it has is a set of noisy sensors and it needs to make meaning from the
  signals of those sensors.  Bootstrapping seems tough!

* One of the benefits of the predictive processing paradigm: the situated state
  of cognition continually provides training data (you guess what's going to
  happen next, then the universe reveals the answer).

* Neural matter is incredibly dense.  An MNIST network can fit into .002 cubic
  mm of mouse cortex.

* The (comprehensible) universe is structured and compositional.  Hierarchy in
  the brains is used to perceive this structure.

* Hierarchical predictive coding: only the error signal ("surprisal") at each
  level is propagated up to a higher level.  This saves neural bandwidth.

* Perception actually occurs when our predictions align with our sensory data.

* Evidence is presented for "dynamic predictive coding" in retinal cells; the
  cells act to strip predictable elements from the visual stream so only the
  most noteworthy elements of the stream get forwarded up the hierarchy.

* Evidence is presented for bi-stable binocular rivalry.  If you show a subject
  two different images, one in each eye, they will generally alternate between
  perceiving one and the other.  When you perceive image 1, error is minimized
  for that image but high error is coming from image 2, so you change your
  prior and minimize the error for image 2 but this exacerbates image 1
  error. "Hyperpriors" are mentioned, priors that are deeply
  rooted/baked-in like the 2 different images can't both be occupying your
  visual field.

* Empirical bayes: your has priors, those priors get updated as evidence comes
  in to minimize error.  Perception is minimization of sensory prediction
  error.

* Predictive processing conceptualizes the forward flow as conveying error and
  the backward flow as conveying prediction that can "explain away" error.
  Thus it can both magnify or inhibit selectively.

* Evidence for the bayesian brain is presented.  A number of optical illusions
  can be recreated by using optimal Bayesian estimators.  Hollow mask illusion
  occurs in neurotypical people but less so in schizophrenics (perhaps
  suggesting schizophrenia is related to broken priors or prediction engines.)

* Predictive processing sees the brain as an active, generative thing
  ("proactive predictavores") rather than a passive recorder.

**THOUGHTS**: Good to read at a high-level and then fill in the picture with
targetted reviews.  A bit confused, are there both representational and error
neurons or is that all combined in the communication between layers.  Brains
are proactive predictavores.
