**Work in progress**

Inspired by the [posts](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/post-index/) of UCSD's Tom
Murphy on societal energy consumption, I wanted to dig deeper into the
implications of our energy consumptions habits at an individual level.


**An individual's energy consumption**

How much energy do Americans consume on a per capita basis?  The USA had
roughly $$3.3\times10^8$$ people in it in 2019[^1] and we consumed 100
quadrillion BTUs in 2019 (roughly $$1\times10^{20}$$ joules)[^2].  This works
out to $$3\times10^{11}$$ joules per person in 2019.  Given that there are
roughly $$3\times10^7$$ seconds in a year, we find that each American draws a
continuous $$1\times10^4$$ watts.

That is to say, our energy consumption is equivalent every American drawing
10,000 watts at all times.  That sounds like a lot![^3]  Obviously, this
varies greatly at the individual level and these numbers include electricity
as well as transportation and manufacturing.  I think, however, that this is a
reasonably good proxy for what would be required to maintain an American
lifestyle.

As a baseline for comparison, we can also calculate how much energy our bodies
consume just by existing.  Assuming we need 2000 calories a day to sustain
ourselves, we find that humans draw about 100 watts to sustain life[^4].  Thus
a modern lifestyle requires two orders of magnitude more energy than the basal
energy requirements of sustaining a person's life.

**Sustaining an individual's energy consumption**

**TODO**
* How much land do we need to cover an individual's energy needs (optimal vs
  realistic)?
* How much land do we need to cover an individual's energy needs using "low
  tech" solutions?
* How do we convert energy to satisfy Maslow's hierarchy (food, water, etc)?
* What would a low-tech sustainable lifestyle look like?  How much energy/land
  would be required?
* Is there a low tech way to create solar panels?  Would would a completely
  off-the-grid existence look like?
* Storage?  How much space for storage of energy?
* Culmination: what does a sustainable off-the-grid life look like with AND
  without modern society surrounding you?
* Plausibility of the argument re offloading energy consumption to other societies via overseas manufacturing etc.

[^3]: I find it less surprising when converted to gallons of gasoline.  This
      10 kilowatt continuous draw is equivalent to burning 7 gallons of gas a
      day to sustain each of our energy demands.  That I find this
      formulation less surprising probably suggests that my intuitions around
      the energy stored in gas are off.

      4.184\times10^3\frac{\text{joules}}{\text{cal}} 
      \cdot 2\times10^3\frac{\text{cal}}{\text{day}}
      = 8.36\times10^6\frac{\text{joules}}{\text{day}}
      $$

      $$
      8.36\times10^6\frac{\text{joules}}{\text{day}}
      \cdot 8.64\times10^{-4}\frac{\text{day}}{\text{sec}}
      = 100 \frac{\text{joules}}{\text{sec}} = 100\text{ watts}
      $$
